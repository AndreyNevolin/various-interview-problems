How would you implement indexing of pictures for a web search engine?

Some options:
1. Use ALT text
2. Analyze surrounding text
3. Use page title
4. Use the name of the picture file
5. Feature extractor - try to extract and recognize features shown on the picture and use
   this information to index the picture
6. Use a tool similar to Google's Image Sitemap (which is an xml-based description of
   pictures intended exactly for search engines). In more general terms (without referring
   to a particular implementation): give site developers a tool for describing pictures
